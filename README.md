# 2020-science-fair-simulation
Run `./gradlew build` to build and `./gradlew run` to run.
In `build.gradle`, change `mainClassName` to change the
class that is being built and run. Main.kt contains the class
for running the simulation while test classes are contained in
other files (i.e. TestKMeans.kt)
